Word Embedding Benchmark (web) package is focused on providing methods for easy evaluating and reporting
results on common benchmarks (analogy, similarity and categorization).

Research goal of the package is to help drive research in word embeddings by easily accessible reproducible
results (as there is a lot of contradictory results in the literature right now).
This should also help to answer question if we should devise new methods for evaluating word embeddings.

To evaluate your embedding (converted to word2vec or python dict pickle)
on all fast-running benchmarks execute `./scripts/eval_on_all.py <path-to-file>`.
See `here <https://github.com/kudkudak/word-embeddings-benchmarks/wiki>`_ results for embeddings available in the package.

Features:

* scikit-learn API and conventions
* 17 popular datasets
* 8 word embeddings (word2vec, HPCA, morphoRNNLM, GloVe, HDC/PDC and others)
* methods to solve analogy, similarity and categorization tasks

Included datasets:

* WordRep
* Google Analogy
* MSR Analogy
* SemEval2012
* AP 
* BLESS
* Battig
* ESSLI (2b, 2a, 1c)
* WS353
* MTurk
* RG65
* RW
* SimLex999
* MEN

Note: embeddings are not hosted currently on a proper server, if the download is too slow consider downloading embeddings manually from original sources referred in docstrings.
